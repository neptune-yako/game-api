            <p className="mb-3">
              The Conditions of Use section of our Terms of Service explains what kind of content and activities are allowed on Cuboid.AI, and what kinds are not. These content rules are also part of these Community Guidelines. They apply not just on the Cuboid.AI platform but also on our Community Forum and on third-party Cuboid-related forums such as Subreddits, Discords, and other social platforms.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3">
              Among the key rules: Don't do or post anything on Cuboid that is hateful or harassing, that seeks to harm others or yourself, or that seeks to exploit minors. Please read the Conditions of Use for all the details, and please follow them! It'll help ensure a positive experience for everyone on the platform.

            <p className="mb-3">
              We want our community to become a key part of the Cuboid.AI experience. That's why we have this Community page – it's a place to ask questions, share tips, provide feedback to the development team, and together explore what we can build with AI.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-3">
              To keep the Community page useful and constructive, please follow these guidelines (in addition to the content rules discussed above):
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-8 space-y-1 mb-3 text-lg">
              <li>Keep it Civil & Respectful. Everyone should feel safe and comfortable participating in the community. Be respectful of others″ opinions and beliefs. Personal attacks, doxing, name-calling, and other forms of abuse towards community members, developers, employees, organizations, etc. are not acceptable. All discussions should be constructive and carried out in a civil manner.</li>
              <li>Post Relevancy. Posts must be relevant to Cuboid.AI. Any self-promotion or promotion of other tools or services is not allowed. Comparisons with other chat tools or discussions of other AI technologies may be allowed if they are clearly constructive to Cuboid.AI products and services.</li>
              <li>Don't Advertise, Spam, or Self-Promote. No advertising, self-promotion, spamming, code giveaways, or irrelevant link sharing.</li>
              <li><strong>Keep Content Safe For Work. Cuboid.AI does not and will not support the use of the software for obscene or pornographic content. We do not allow discussion of NSFW filters – our stance is final, and requesting them to be removed may result in a ban.</strong></li>
              <li>Impersonation. Do not impersonate any individual or an entity in a misleading or deceptive manner. Users impersonating a staff member will be immediately banned.</li>
              <li>Misinformation. Sharing false information and promoting inaccurate statements is not allowed; this includes and is not limited to conspiracy theories, misleading verbiage, and accusations.</li>
              <li>Other Disallowed Content. All content must be posted in the appropriate channels. Repeated posts of very similar feedback or content (spamming) is not allowed. Posts asking for changes to the system that have already been addressed in Announcements or the FAQ will be removed.</li>
            </ul>
